# Real-Time Collaborative Text Editor with React & Firebase

Welcome to the **Real-Time Collaborative Text Editor** project! This editor, styled like Google Docs, allows multiple users to edit a document simultaneously with live updates. Built using **React**, **Firebase**, and **React Quill**, this project demonstrates key features such as real-time synchronization and optimized database interactions.

### Project Overview

This project is a collaborative text editor inspired by Google Docs. Users can edit documents in real-time, and changes are immediately synced across all connected clients. By leveraging Firebase Firestore for real-time updates, we achieve both smooth interactions and minimal database usage.

### Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit the same document, with each change appearing in real-time.
- **Firebase Firestore Integration**: Document changes are stored and synchronized using Firestoreâ€™s real-time database.
- **Google Docs-Like UI**: An intuitive, Google Docs-inspired UI for a familiar editing experience.
